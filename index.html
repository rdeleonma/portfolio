                    <h5>HTML &amp;CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</h5>
    			     <p>This was a project I coded from scratch given a design comp as part of my online course. I really enjoyed working on this one, especially because it didn't take me long to figure it out as a beginner.</p>

    				<h4><span class="headline">Jubilee Austen Project</span></h4>
    				<h5>HTML 5 &amp;CSS Website</h5>
    				<p>This was my very first project. With a little guidance along the way I was able to get this coded and styled in a few hours time. I was and still am very proud of my work on this one!</p>

    				<h4><span class="headline">Recipe Collection</span><br> HTML 5 &amp;CSS Exercise</h4>
    				<p>This is another exercise coded and styled from a design comp as part of my courses. This one gave me a challenge, but it paid off in the end because I learned and was able to practice a lot of new skills on it!</p>

                            <h6>I put my all into everything I do.</h6>
    				        <p>I got into web design after realizing that in order to find a career I would enjoy I needed to find something that I could apply my diverse <span>and quite quirky</span> skillset to. This led me to a field where my highly inquisitive nature, attention to detail, and perserverance would come in very handy.  When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I'd found something that gave me the freedom, versatility, and satisfaction I was looking for in my work and I never looked back.</p>
                        </div>            
    				    <p>I am looking forward to creating something great with you!</p>
